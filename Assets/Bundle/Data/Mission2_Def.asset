  DetailText: Set loose upon the Kribensis system, the OSP gets to work. There are
    convoys to raid, and infrastructure to wreck, all in the pursuit of drawing the
    Alliance's attention and resources away from the war-winning gate transit assault
    that will soon descend on Bethel. Your squadron finds itself in pursuit of one
    such convoy, halfway through its journey across the system from Ekota gate to
    Bethel gate.

    OSPN EXCEPTION TO THE
    RULE //

    INTRASHIP DISPATCH: PRIORITY ATLAS //

    FOR IMMEDIATE ROUTING
    TO: CIC //


    Hey skipper, it''s Furoc-Austin down here in the intel centre.
    I got a fresh intercept for you, hot off the airwaves. This might explain why
    those two freighters we''re chasin'' diverted course into that asteroid cluster.
    And it''s quite funny, if I do say so myself. See attached.

    Mayday! Mayday! This is Captain Joral of the Ekota Republic Trading
    Guild, calling anyone in the local volume. We are under attack! Where is the
    Alliance Navy?!


    This is the ANS Unyielding Stare, Task Force Arbutus. We
    read your distress signal, but there seems to be a problem. We don''t have you
    on our records, Captain - please turn on your transponder and immediately provide
    your identification and manifest.


    Uh, with me is ERTS Adscita''s Star and
    ERTS Belya''s Comet, of Convoy 92, we have a shipment of fuel and spare parts
    from Anamur for the garrison at Bethel gate. We were jumped by rebel ships as
    we crossed the outer belt - aren''t you supposed to have the system secure? The
    latest Navy bulletin said the enemy incursion was small and almost dealt with.


    Thank
    you, Captain - this is all very interesting because it looks like Convoy 92 is
    currently waiting at Ekota gate for their assigned escort to arrive before setting
    off. And yet, here you are, several light-hours away, transponder off, in the
    middle of an active warzone. Am I to surmise that you, shall we say, jumped the
    gun?


    The Trading Guild demands a strict timeline, our escort was taking
    too long, and your bulletin said the system was safe! Look, the terrorists are
    in pursuit as we speak, I do not have time for this. I am a citizen of the Ekota
    Republic, a full member nation of the Shelter Alliance, and I am formally requesting
    your immediate assistance, or my representatives will hear about this, one way
    or another.


    Receiving you, Captain. My task force will be en route ASAP
    to secure the safety of your ships, and escort you back to Ekota gate for a full
    investigation into how this incident was allowed to occur. Transmit all relevant
    information on your encounter with OSP forces and change course to the attached
    coordinates to meet us. Task Force Arbutus, out.


    END DISPATCH //
