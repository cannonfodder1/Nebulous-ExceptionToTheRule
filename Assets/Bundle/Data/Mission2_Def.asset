  DetailText: With the Alliance on the attack, the convoy raiding effort is in peril.
    The asteroid belt of Kribensis blisters and boils with heavy jamming, as the
    Alliance uses their electronic warfare superiority to cut down OSP raiding groups
    one by one. There's only one ship in the battlegroup that can make a stand. Silence
    the jammers, and bring this counteroffensive to a halt.

    NAVY-LINK COMM.\r\nVOICE TRANSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n--- N. Vance has joined the call
    ---\r\n\r\nV: Pick up, you bastard.\r\n\r\n--- B. Stratis has joined the call
    ---\r\n\r\nS: Reporting as ordered, Captain.\r\n\r\nV: As of this very moment
    I am pinned under a rock and there's a squadron of beam destroyers on my ass,
    so we need to keep this brief. Is your ship combat-capable?\r\n\r\nS: We just
    got another two freighters and their escorts, no significant damage.\r\n\r\nV:
    You and the other raiding groups have been doing ace work, but whoever's in command
    over there is being a massive pain in my ass. There's an Alliance taskforce loose
    in our rear area and they've been torching the supply dumps we set up around
    the system. If they're allowed to continue running wild, we'll run out of the
    fuel and missiles we need for offensive operations.\r\n\r\nS: So we're going
    to withdraw back to Roclaren, right?\r\n\r\nV: Are you fucking high?\r\n\r\nS:
    Sounds to me like they've pulled a significant portion of their forces away from
    their jumping off point at the gate to Bethel to react to our incursion. Which,
    as far as our official mission goes, is exactly what we were supposed to provoke.
    It's time to get out before -\r\n\r\nV: Cease the quitter talk. Every week we
    keep them occupied here is another week the shipyards have to militarize more
    freighters for the gate blockade. We have to stay in the system and remain a
    threat for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nS: But ma'am - \r\n\r\nV: Enough. We can
    discuss strategy further once I tear these fucking destroyers apart.\r\n\r\nS:
    Where do you want me, then?\r\n\r\nV: As I was saying, that marauding taskforce
    has to be stopped. I sent a few other ships to do the job, but they were sent
    packing by an ungodly amount of electronic warfare. And when it comes to dealing
    with that shit, your cruiser has no equal. We've been tracking their drive flares,
    and you're close enough to interdict them at their jumping off point before they
    hit another one of our fuel caches. I want them smashed into dust.\r\n\r\nS:
    Aye ma'am.\r\n\r\nV: I'm detaching a lineship to join you, it should provide
    some additional firepower for - \r\n\r\n(background voices detected) SPIKER!
    Spiker spiker spiker! Count four incoming, range three kilo, bearing two-five-one
    by zero-six-four, speed -\r\n\r\nV: Oh fuck - \r\n\r\n(background voices detected)
    PDTs are up, Bastion net engaging, splash one -\r\n\r\nV: Gotta go!\r\n\r\n---
