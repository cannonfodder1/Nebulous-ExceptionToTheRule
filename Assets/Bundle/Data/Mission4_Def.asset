  DetailText: With the Alliance counterattack blunted, the OSP forces in Kribensis
    must plan their next move. Incoming reinforcements could turn the tables with
    the latest tech from Roclaren, if the path back home can be kept open. Run the
    trench and bring the big guns to bear - but be wary, and never trust the intel
    department.

    OSPN MOMENTARY LAPSE OF SANITY

    F: OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE


    Lieutenant
    Hashim, time to wake up, we''ve got an emergency on our hands. I don''t want
    another one of your bullshit automated responses about how you''re "out of office",
    you will read this message and send an immediate affirmation or I will get your
    XO to relieve you.


    Eight drive flares just lit up on a braking burn into
    a rock cluster between the edge of the system and our area of operations. I can''t
    tell you everything, but we have reinforcements arriving here from Roclaren soon,
    and it is absolutely imperative that they have a clear path to get to us without
    their composition being visually identified. So you need to get over there and
    ensure they aren''t. Normally I''d send Stratis but his fragile flower of a cruiser
    is laid up for repairs. And your squadron is the next-best suited for an attack
    into the teeth of Alliance jamming.


    To pre-empt what I know you''re typing
    up right now, yes, your Journeyman is still completely crippled from that torpedo
    you took, and no, this cannot wait for it to be repaired. The carrier will be
    safe here with me while you''re out saving the day. Get the rest of your squadron
    moving now, no delays.


    - Vance
