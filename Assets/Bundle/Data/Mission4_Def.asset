  DetailText: The Alliance counterattack continues, as the battlegroup begins to
    run low on essential supplies. Incoming reinforcements from OSP space could turn
    the campaign around, if the path back home can be kept open. Run the trench and
    bring the big guns to bear - but be wary, and never trust the intel department.

    Hashim, wake the fuck up, we've got an emergency on our hands. I don't want another
    one of your bullshit automated responses about how you're \"out of office\",
    you will read this message and send an immediate affirmation or I will get your
    XO to relieve you.\r\n\r\nEight drive flares just lit up on a braking burn into
    a rock cluster between the edge of the system and our area of operations. I can't
    tell you everything, but we have reinforcements arriving here from Roclaren soon,
    and it is absolutely imperative that they have a clear path to get to us without
    their composition being visually identified. So you need to get over there and
    clean that shit up. Normally I'd send Stratis but his fragile flower of a fuckin'
    cruiser is laid up for repairs. And your squadron is the next-best suited for
    an attack into the teeth of Alliance jamming.\r\n\r\nTo pre-empt the string of
    panicked replies I know you're typing up right now, no Stratis does not know
    about this yet, yes you are still supposed to be joining up with his squadron,
    and no you will not waste time informing him of your course deviation. Stratis
    will get the fucking memo and you'll be back as soon as you're done saving the
    fucking day. Get your squadron moving NOW, that is an order.\r\n\r\n- Vance\r"
