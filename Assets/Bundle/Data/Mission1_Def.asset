    EMPEROR REVERSE. INTRASHIP MAIL.\r\nTO: BSTRATIS\r\nFROM: NOVANCE\r\n\r\nStratis,
    \r\n\r\nI've got news for you. Constantine gave me one of his precious cruisers
    from the Roclaren mothball yards, a rusty old bucket, but a true warship. It's
    better than any of our converted freighters. And there's no way in hell I'm taking
    it. I built my flagship with grit, spit, and a whole lot of duct tape, I'm not
    trading her out just on the Old Man's say so. Also, equally as importantly, I'm
    not driving one of these fuckin' missile-proof heavy-armoured military ships
    into battle, hell no, I'm a real spacer. So, getting back to my point: I figured
    this sort of cowardly asset would be right up your alley. I'll be sad to not
    have you onboard to second-guess all my genius plans, but it's about time you
    got a ship of your own. And don't tell Constantine about this, you hear? \r\n\r\n-

    NAVY-LINK COMM.\r\nT: OSPN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE\r\nF: OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE\r\n\r\nStratis,\r\n\r\nHope
    you've settled into your new command, because it's go time. I just got off the
    phone with the Old Man: we're heading into Kribensis to do some old fashioned
    convoy raiding. Defenses at home are far from ready - if the Alliance pushes
    through the Kribensis-Bethel gate now, the OSP is well and truly fucked. Our
    job is to blow up a few freighters, slow the enemy buildup on their side of the
    gate, and buy Constantine some goddamn time. We're heading into hyperspace via
    breach torpedo in under 48 hours, but I want you to take the Exception ahead
    and clear the emergence zone for the rest of the battlegroup. I don't want the
    Alliance having any spotters nearby when the rest of us arrive, that'd give those
    wrinkly brains over at the Alliance Naval Office a far better picture of our
    numbers than I'd like. A sensor vessel will be tagging along as well, it'll be
    useful out there. Once it arrives, you are cleared to depart. Safe travels.\r\n\r\n-
    Vance\r"
