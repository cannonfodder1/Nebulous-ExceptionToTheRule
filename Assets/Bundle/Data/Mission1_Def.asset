  DetailText: The people of Bethel, Roclaren, and Pyxis have seized their freedom,
    but it may not last the year. To buy time for the gate blockade to be assembled,
    the OSP must take the war to the Alliance. Unexpectedly promoted into command,
    prove yourself at the helm of your new ship. Hunt down an Alliance patrol in
    deep space, securing a hyperspace emergence point for the rest of the battlegroup.

    EMPEROR REVERSE. INTRASHIP MAIL.\r\nFROM: NOVANCE\r\nTO: BSTRATIS\r\n\r\nStratis,
    \r\n\r\nI've got news for you. Constantine gave me one of the newly reactivated
    cruisers from the Roclaren mothball yards, a rusty old bucket, but a true warship.
    It's better than any of our converted freighters, and there's no way in hell
    I'm taking it. I built my flagship with grit, spit, and a whole lot of duct tape,
    I'm not trading her out just on the Old Man's say so. Also, equally as importantly,
    I'm not driving one of these fuckin' missile-proof heavy-armoured military ships
    into battle, hell no, I'm a real spacer. So, getting back to my point: I figured
    this sort of cowardly asset would be right up your alley. I'll be sad to not
    have you as onboard as XO to second-guess all my genius plans, but it's about
    time you got a ship of your own.\r\n\r\nOkay, enough praise. You're going to
    have to get this bitch and her crew into shape real fast, because we've got a
    job to do. The reason we're getting new metal is because within the month, we'll
    be heading into Kribensis to do some old fashioned convoy raiding. Defenses in
    Bethel are far from ready - if the Alliance pushes through the Kribensis-Bethel
    gate now, the OSP is well and truly fucked. Our job is to blow up a few freighters,
    slow the enemy buildup on their side of the gate, and buy Constantine some goddamn
    time. You'll probably be going in with the first wave, along with a sensor vessel
    or two to clear out any pickets at the system edge, so yeah - get her ready ASAP.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm not supposed to be telling anyone the mission yet, just as I'm technically
    not supposed to pawn off command of our most capable combat unit onto my trusty
    XO, so keep this info to yourself, you hear?\r\n\r\n- Vance\r\n"
