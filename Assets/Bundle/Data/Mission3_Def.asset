  DetailText: "As the force buildup on both sides of the Kribensis-Bethel gate approaches
    its zenith, the fluid opening stage of the war threatens to harden into a stalemate.
    Deep in the fog of war, the factions execute their endgames. Lead your squadron
    in a surprise attack against a crucial Alliance supply depot - but be wary, and
    never trust the intel department.\r"

    // KRIBENSIS BUOY 09-VVV-2\r\nRELAY IMMEDIATE. PRIORITY ONE\r\n\r\nMESSAGE HEADER
    //\r\nXX: IDENT -: WO. SAMUEL ACE\r\n\r\nHey boss, I know I'm not technically
    supposed to have the permissions to slap Priority One on message traffic, but
    if I didn't slam this through it would have taken days to get to you. Half of
    our comms buoys are down pending maintenance right now, the budget for a replacement
    system has been stalled in committee for the last six years so it seems we're
    stuck with this junk. Anyway, you should relay this to the Admiral. Like, right
    now. We got real lucky here and I don't want it to go to waste, with this we
    can nail the OSPN to the wall. I know faking message priorities is grounds for
    dishonourable discharge, but I think you'll agree it's justified once you read
    the intercept.\r\n\r\nMESSAGE CONTENT //\r\nXX: INTERCEPT -: OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE\r\n\r\n[corrupted
    data] ...ank you all for coming. I'll get straight to the point: just yesterday
    reinforcements arrived in-system from Bethel, with some shiny new tech that'll
    have those [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] in Shelter quaking in their boots, but more importantly,
    a message from Constantine. Our home needs three weeks. Those are our orders.
    The Old Man asks for three weeks, and the OSPN shall answer.\r\n\r\nSo, the plan
    is as follows. Naval Station Zodiac-Five, or NAVSTA Z-5 for those in a hurry,
    is one of the two main refueling stops for all Alliance Navy operations in the
    inner system. Z-5's garrison should be light after we pull it out of position
    by hitting the diversionary targets which I'll cover in a second, but I'm assigning
    our cruiser to this one, because even if the Alliance doesn't take the bait,
    I want them [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] obliterated. That means you, Stra... [corrupted
    data]\r\n\r\nMESSAGE ENDS //\r"
