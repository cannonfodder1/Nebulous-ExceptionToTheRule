    // KRIBENSIS BUOY 09-VVV-2\r\nRELAY IMMEDIATE. PRIORITY ONE\r\n\r\nMESSAGE HEADER
    //\r\nXX: IDENT -: WO. SAMUEL ACE\r\n\r\nHey boss, I know I\u2019m not technically
    supposed to have the permissions to slap Priority One on message traffic, but
    if I didn\u2019t slam this through it would have taken days to get to you. Half
    of our comms buoys are down pending maintenance right now, the budget for a replacement
    system has been stalled in committee for the last seven years so it seems we\u2019re
    stuck with this junk. Anyway, you should relay this to the Admiral. Like, right
    now. We got real lucky here and I don\u2019t want it to go to waste. I know faking
    message priorities is grounds for dishonourable discharge, but I think you\u2019ll
    agree it\u2019s justified once you read the intercept.\r\n\r\nMESSAGE CONTENT
    //\r\nXX: INTERCEPT -: OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE\r\n\r\n[corrupted data] ...ank you
    all for coming. I\u2019ll get straight to the point: our logistical situation
    is well and truly [EXPLETIVE REMOVED]. Now, as I\u2019m sure Stratis is keen
    to remind us, this would normally mean a withdrawal from the system. However,
    just yesterday reinforcements arrived in-system from Bethel, with some shiny
    new tech that\u2019ll have those [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] in Shelter quaking in their
    boots, but more importantly, a message from Constantine. \r\n\r\nOur home needs
    three weeks. They haven\u2019t told me what\u2019s going to happen then, I assume
    that\u2019ll be the peak of the force buildup on our side of the Kribensis-Bethel
    gate, or maybe tha... [corrupted data] ...ay, we have our orders. The Old Man
    asks for three weeks, and the OSPN shall answer.\r\n\r\nSo, the plan is as follows.
    We\u2019re going to g... [corrupted data] ...nd now for the target list. First
    up, Garibaldi, you\u2019ll be taking your monitors to the astrographic relay
    in sect... [corrupted data] ...ight need a heavy breacher complement to take
    that one. Finally, we come to the main prize of this operation. Naval Station
    Zodiac-Five, or NAVSTA Z-5 for those in a hurry, is one of the two main refueling
    stops for all Alliance Navy operations in the inner system. Z-5\u2019s garrison
    should be light to medium, but I\u2019m assigning our cruiser, because I want
    it [EXPLETIVE REMOVED] obliterated. That means you, Stra... [corrupted data]\r\n"
