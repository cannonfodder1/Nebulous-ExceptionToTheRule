  CampaignName: Exception to the Rule (OSP Campaign)
  Description: After a century without any external threat to bind them together,
    tensions between the Shelter Alliance's member nations have exploded into open
    war. The Outlying Systems Protectorate has claimed its independence, but how
    long it will last remains to be seen. The Alliance Navy readies itself for an
    assault through the Kribensis-Bethel hyperspace gate, aiming to crush the upstart
    rebellion in one swift stroke. Take command of the reactivated cruiser OSPN Exception
    to the Rule in the war's opening stage, and face down the behemoth that approaches.
